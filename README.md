# ScreenRecorder

This app is for recording a series of screenshots to disk.
Right now that means to an animated [PNG](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/) file.

This code is ultimately a fork of the PNG writer.
See [here](https://github.com/curtcox/apng-writer/tree/delete_unneeded_stuff) for where it came from.
